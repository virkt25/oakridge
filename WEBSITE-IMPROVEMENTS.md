# Oakridge Children Services - Website Improvement Recommendations

## Current State Assessment

**What's Working Well:**
- Clean, modern design with professional color scheme
- Strong SEO foundation (7 schema types, geo-targeting, meta tags)
- Mobile-responsive with floating CTAs
- Clear service descriptions
- Trust signals present (RBA supervised, OAP eligible)
- Accessibility considerations (skip links, ARIA labels)
- Fast loading (no framework bloat, ~111KB total)

**Areas for Improvement:**
The site has a solid foundation but lacks key elements that would establish it as the best ABA therapy website in the industry.

---

## 1. PHOTOGRAPHY & IMAGERY (Critical Priority)

**Current State:** Placeholder icons only, no real photos

**Recommendation:** Professional photography is the #1 improvement

**Must-Have Photos:**
1. **Hero Image:** Warm photo of therapist working with child (with parent consent)
2. **Centre Photos:** Bright, welcoming therapy rooms and facilities
3. **Team Photos:** Professional headshots of RBAs and therapists
4. **Candid Moments:** Children engaged in activities (blocks, games, etc.)
5. **Parent-Therapist:** Collaboration/training session imagery

**Why This Matters:**
- Parents making healthcare decisions need to SEE the environment
- Faces build trust - anonymous services feel risky for child therapy
- Competitors with real photos will always outperform stock images

**Implementation Options:**
| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Professional photoshoot | $500-2,000 | Best quality, 2-3 hour session |
| Stock photos (ABA-specific) | $100-300 | Istock, Adobe Stock - search "child therapy" |
| DIY with guidelines | $0 | Can work with good lighting + guidelines |

**Photo Guidelines:**
- Natural lighting preferred
- Warm, welcoming tones
- Diverse representation
- ALWAYS get written consent for any child photos
- Focus on hands/activities if faces are sensitive

---

## 2. TEAM & CREDENTIALS (High Priority)

**Current State:** No team information beyond "RBA supervised"

**Recommendation:** Add dedicated "Our Team" section

**What to Include:**

```
MEET OUR TEAM

- Differentiates from competitors who hide their team

**Specific Credentials to Highlight:**
- BCBA / BCBA-D certifications
- RBA designations
- Years of experience

## 3. RESULTS & OUTCOMES (High Priority)

**Current State:** Generic testimonials without specifics

**Recommendation:** Add quantifiable outcomes and success stories

**Data Points to Gather & Display:**
```
OUR IMPACT
──────────
• 94% of families report meaningful skill improvements
• Average 40% increase in communication abilities after 6 months
• 87% parent satisfaction rating
• 150+ children served since opening
• 12,000+ therapy hours delivered
```

**Case Studies (Anonymized):**
```
SUCCESS STORY: "Alex's Journey"

When Alex (age 4) started therapy, he had fewer than 10 words
and struggled with transitions.

After 12 months of ABA therapy:
✓ 200+ word vocabulary
✓ Combines 3-4 word sentences
✓ Successfully transitioned to mainstream preschool
✓ Independently plays with siblings

"Oakridge gave us our son's voice." - Alex's parents
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Parents want evidence that therapy WORKS
- Specific outcomes are more convincing than vague promises
- Demonstrates measurement and accountability
- Sets realistic expectations

## 7. COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION

Look at other ABA providers in Brampton/GTA and identify gaps.

**Potential Differentiators to Highlight:**

| Differentiator | How to Communicate |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Extended hours | "Open Saturdays - Because Therapy Shouldn't Wait" |

## 8. CONTENT VOICE & MESSAGING

**Current Tone:** Professional but somewhat clinical

**Recommendation:** Warmer, more empathetic voice

**Before:**
> "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a scientific approach to understanding behavior and how it is affected by the environment."

**After:**
> "Every child learns differently. ABA therapy meets your child exactly where they are, using positive reinforcement and patience to help them build skills at their own pace. It's not about changing who your child is—it's about giving them tools to thrive."

**Key Messaging Principles:**
1. Lead with empathy, not credentials
2. Address parent fears directly
3. Use "your child" not "children with autism"
4. Celebrate small wins
5. Avoid clinical jargon in headlines

---
